####The Good:

**Art Style**

They nailed the art style, Film Noire feeling with classical future tones, it looks like what I imagine a Blade Runner Cartoon would look like.

**Rewind feature**

There is an option to rewind a single move or more, what a great idea for this type of thing. 

**Tutorials**

The tutorials are very thorough but don’t actually make you feel more a moron as you play, they are aimed at intelligent logical gamers not 13 year olds.

**Install Size**

Steam says its requires 2GB of space installed. The actual download was far less than that but damn, they did a LOT with that space! I am ***very*** 
impressed with that 

**Excellent UI**

Really, this UI makes you feel like a secret spy from the future! - Reminds me of Introversions Uplink! - is this game in many ways inspired by Uplink? (Uplink is also a Linux game and its only £5.99 [on 
Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/1510/))

**Option are awesome!**

This game has option, select a monitor, select a resolution, vsync settings, Bloom settings, shadows, colour blind mode, damn.. this is how is 
*should* be done by everyone. Made me happy!

####The Bad:

**AI seems a bit thick**

At one point the guard saw me, i stepped one space to the left and he shouted "HE'S ESCAPED!" made me smile, I hope that was a joke rather than an actual example of the ai

**"Warning!" "Warning!" "Warning!"**

God damn, in the first few missions I heard "Warning!" more than I really needed to!

**Terminology tries a little hard!**

"We beamed you onto the Grid agent" is just one example of the mixing pot of terms used on this game, There's Necromancer inspired tek talk, star trek words and BladeRunner terms on top of some Tron dialogue.... Iv'e put it in the 
'Bad' section because its daft but personally I liked its nonsense because I'm wired that way :) 

**is my screen broken?**

the UI, popups has this odd light smudge effect on it that honestly made me think my VCR Tracking was out. 

####Thoughts. 

Invisible, Inc. Is a very well designed game, its is one of those rare games where the developer had a vision, then through hard work and excellent code they nailed the vision. the vision however is not without its flaws.
