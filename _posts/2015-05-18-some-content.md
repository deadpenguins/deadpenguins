**Dead Penguins** is an upcoming Video-Stream-Podcast-Chat-Thing where our enigmatic hosts talk about their own adventures in the realm of Linux use, problems and solutions that have effected them, Open source news items, and a healthy dose of Linux gaming thoughts and commentary. **Dead Penguins** will be heavily focused on viewer interaction and submitted content is more than welcome. 

**Dead Penguins** is not for the die hard Linux elitist, its for real world users who understand that some times those binary blobs just make life easier. You will not hear our hosts badmouth or berate other Operating Systems. Too many internet shows are already making a focussing on that. This show is about how we use our Linux, not how we hate its competition. 

The show will be available for a live audience over on the [Hitbox](http://www.hitbox.tv/hexdsl) streaming site for its first few episodes (its hard to find a penguin friendly streaming service) but all episodes will be available on its [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hexdsl) archive.  we will also encourage feedback via our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadpenguins/) page
